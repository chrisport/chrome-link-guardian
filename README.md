# Experiment: Anti Phishing chrome extension

No guarantees, this is experimental and generated using AI.

## Description

This chrome extension will warn you when a suspicious link is clicked. 
By default any link is considered suspicious that leads away from the current hostname.
Hostnames and subdomains that you know, can be allowlisted to avoid over-alerting.

After an initial phase of adding your allowlisted hostnames, the extension warning will be effective in alerting on any new hostname and therefore reduce the risk of falling for a phishing attack.

## Usage

Simply download the extension from the Chrome Web Store

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Click on Load unpacked and select the folder where you saved the extension
